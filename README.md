The **J**ob **a**nd **T**ask **s**cheduling **l**ibrary is a small tool for managing asynchronous pieces of ephemeral work (tasks) and continous work (jobs). It has been extracted from [WebGrid](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid) for use by other projects. Detailed documentation and tests will follow as time permits :)

For now, you can take a look at any [service implementation of WebGrid](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid/tree/main/core/src/services) to get a better picture on how this works.
